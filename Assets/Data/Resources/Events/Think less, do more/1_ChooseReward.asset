  DialogueText: "The city bells toll in a frantic chorus. From the crashing shoreline,
    a beast rises\u2014its scales glinting like wet bronze, waves curling high behind
    it. The people scatter, the gates slam shut, and cries of fear echo through narrow
    streets.\n\nAkhilleus does not wait for counsel, nor for omens. He straps on
    his sword-belt, steps forward, and speaks in a voice that cuts through the chaos:\n\"Victory
    does not come to those who hesitate. One step forward\u2026 and the battle is
    already half-won.\""
