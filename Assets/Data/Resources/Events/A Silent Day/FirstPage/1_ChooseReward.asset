  DialogueText: "The river is unusually still, its surface smooth as polished glass.
    As you approach, the sounds of the forest fade until not even the wind dares
    to stir. From the mist above the water, a figure takes shape\u2014tall, faceless,
    draped in flowing garments that shimmer like moonlight on silver.\n\nIt does
    not resemble any god you\u2019ve ever heard of; its presence feels older, stranger,
    as though it belongs to a time forgotten even by the myths. The being does not
    speak, yet you feel its thoughts moving through yours, like ripples disturbing
    calm water.\n\nSlowly, it extends an open hand toward you, and three radiant
    symbols drift in the air:"
