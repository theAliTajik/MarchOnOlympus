  DialogueText: "Night settles heavy as you light a small campfire beneath the twisted
    ruins of a forgotten watchtower. The flames flicker strangely, stretching tall
    shadows against the broken stone. As sleep begins to pull at your eyes, voices
    rise from the darkness\u2014familiar, yet long lost.\n\nOne by one, figures emerge
    from the wavering light: comrades you once fought beside. Their faces are calm,
    their armor dulled and worn, but their presence feels steady and real."
